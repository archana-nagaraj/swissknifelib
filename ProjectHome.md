A generic toolkit for anything needed to help develop cross platform applications. The toolkit wraps around libraries like Boost and STL to offer some handy tools for application development, but not so much to become a framework like ACE.

We use generic programming techniques to ensure the tools are reusable for as many conditions as possible.
